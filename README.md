# ⚡ Piezoelectric Energy Harvesting Floor System

This repository contains the dynamic analysis and power output simulation for a **Smart Floor System** designed to harvest energy from human footfalls.

## 📌 Project Overview
Developed as part of my **Dynamics course**, this project explores sustainable energy solutions for high-traffic urban environments like shopping malls.

### 🔬 Engineering Model
The system converts mechanical stress into electrical charge using the piezoelectric effect:

$$V = \frac{d_{33} \cdot F \cdot h}{\varepsilon_{33}^T \cdot A}$$

### 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python (Numerical simulation)
* **Focus:** Dynamics & Energy Harvesting

## 🇳🇴 Career Goal: Offshore Engineering
As a 3rd-year Mechanical Engineering student, I am focusing on adapting vibration-based energy harvesting technologies to **Offshore Platforms** in the North Sea.
